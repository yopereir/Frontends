  <h1>How to Get Rid of Weeds in Your Landscape</h1>
  <p><em>Posted on Aug 3, 2025</em></p>
  <p>Weeds are the uninvited guests of every landscape. They compete with your plants for sunlight, water, and nutrients, and left unchecked, they can quickly take over your yard. Fortunately, there are effective methods to eliminate and prevent weeds, whether you&rsquo;re dealing with a few patches or an overgrown garden bed.</p>
<h2 id="1-identify-the-weed">1. Identify the Weed</h2>
<p>Before you attack, identify what you&rsquo;re dealing with. Broadleaf weeds (like dandelions), grassy weeds (like crabgrass), and sedges each require different tactics. Knowing your enemy is half the battle.</p>
<h2 id="2-manual-removal">2. Manual Removal</h2>
<p>For small infestations, hand-pulling is effective — especially after rainfall when the soil is soft. Use a weeding tool to extract the root system completely. Be careful not to break the root, or the weed may regrow.</p>
<h2 id="3-mulch">3. Mulch</h2>
<p>Mulching is a gardener’s best friend. A 2–3 inch layer of organic mulch (like bark or straw) smothers weeds, prevents seeds from germinating, and retains soil moisture. Avoid piling mulch against plant stems or tree trunks.</p>
<h2 id="4-landscape-fabric">4. Landscape Fabric</h2>
<p>For long-term control, especially in garden beds or under gravel paths, landscape fabric creates a physical barrier that blocks weed growth. Just be sure to install it properly and cover it with mulch or rock.</p>
<h2 id="5-chemical-control">5. Chemical Control</h2>
<p>When other methods fail, herbicides can be used — but with caution. Non-selective herbicides like glyphosate kill everything they touch, while selective herbicides target specific types of weeds. Always read labels, follow safety instructions, and consider spot-treatment to avoid harming desirable plants.</p>
<h2 id="6-corn-gluten-meal-organic-option">6. Corn Gluten Meal (Organic Option)</h2>
<p>This pre-emergent weed suppressant prevents seeds from sprouting. It’s a natural byproduct of corn processing and safe around pets and children. Apply in early spring for best results.</p>
<h2 id="7-maintain-a-healthy-lawn">7. Maintain a Healthy Lawn</h2>
<p>Weeds thrive in weak lawns. Regular mowing, watering, aeration, and fertilization create a thick turf that chokes out weeds before they can take hold. Overseed thin areas in fall or spring to crowd out invaders.</p>
<h2 id="8-dont-let-them-go-to-seed">8. Don’t Let Them Go to Seed</h2>
<p>One weed can produce thousands of seeds. Remove them before flowering or seeding to prevent future outbreaks. Dispose of weed debris carefully — don’t compost seed heads.</p>
