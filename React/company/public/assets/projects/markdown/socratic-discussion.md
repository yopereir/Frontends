# Socratic Discussion

![Socratic Discussion Poster](/assets/projects/images/socraticDiscussion.webp)

This innovative project aims to create a new sub-genre in gaming, specifically focused on **Debating**.

Think VR Chat, but for debates. In this game, people join an *Agora* (a large open space where Athenians debated), vote on a topic and vote on the people to debate the topic.

Everyone can vote and voting takes place in a style similar to Dynamic Brackets as used on X (Twitter). The topic with the most votes is selected, and the top 2 players are selected to debate (1 player for and the other against the topic).

The 2 debaters are placed on a center stage, where each side takes turns to argue a point. Everyone else votes yay or nay and can perform Actions showing their support or opposition.

The goal of the game is **not** to win the debate but to engage in it. The debate ends when everyone else decides to switch topics, and the cycle continues.

People get XP points for engaging in voting or performing Actions. This XP adds to their level and can be used to unlock cosmetic items or Actions.
