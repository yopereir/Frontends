Inspired by the Cinematic Horror genre games like The Dark Pictures Anthology, Walking Dead, this Game aims to be a Cinematic story and choice driven game based on the Acts of the Apostles.

Unreal Engine 5 will be used with mocap and create cinematic graphics in par with top games in the industry.

The Acts story will be divided into episodes, each covering a different Apostle.

The goal of the game will be to enable the maximum number of people to survive and to share the gospel with as many as possible. Player choices will lead to changes in these outcomes.

Each outcome will have it's own path and associated achievements leading to a lot of replayablity.
